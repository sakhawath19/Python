MISSING VALUE 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-k-Nearest Neighbors that can ignore a column from a distance measure when a value is missing. 
Naive Bayes can also support missing values when making a prediction.

IMPUTE MISSING VALUE

-A constant value that has meaning within the domain, such as 0, distinct from all other values.
-A value from another randomly selected record.
-A mean, median or mode value for the column.
-A value estimated by another predictive model.

-Any imputing performed on the training dataset will have to be performed on new data in the 
future when predictions are needed from the finalized model. This needs to be taken into 
consideration when choosing how to impute the missing values. For example, if you choose 
to impute with mean column values, these mean column values will need to be stored to file 
for later use on new data that has missing values.
